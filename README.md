# Data-Analyst-Essentials
As I embark on my Data Analytics bootcamp, with a focus on Tableau, PowerBi, Python, SQL, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Numpy. I will be using this repository to store my learning projects and practise notebooks

Python-Function-Practise= This notebook documents the Python functions I've practised and mastered using Google Colab.

Ikea Project - Showcases how I have used the Visualisation tool Power BI to highlight critical business insights using a faux Ikea Dataset which first needed some light cleaning and manipulation. I chose to use this project to focus on the 'Loss profile' of certain business areas that I had the data to. With the aim to use this data to advice key business stakeholders and decision-makers on which specific areas are causing Ikea to face losses and to evaluate whether there needs to be changes made to customer relationships, Supplier Relations, Product stocking and the sales department.

Project-Relocation - This is a Project Management focused project for submitted and accessed for the Data Analystics and Project Managment bootcamp which received a grade of 92%.
